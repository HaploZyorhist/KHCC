# KHCC
character creator for kingdom hearts stream 


# To do
-- make a character class that holds the generic stats
-- we want players to be able to adjust starting stats as needed
-- creator should be able to set boundaries on stats to preven system abuse
-- creator should be able to save as txt file and load from txt files

# ideas 
-- main class to run functions not code everything into main.
-- use a windows form app to adjust stats and creation
